\begin{abstract}
        This paper introduces a methodology that integrates quantum computing with machine learning to examine a parameterized quantum circuit with three qubits. Initiated by a Hadamard gate, the circuit progresses through RX, RZ, and RY gates, modulated by parameters $\theta$, $\phi$, and $\zeta$, and is linked by controlled-NOT gates, culminating in a measurement phase. The study leverages a dataset of various parameter configurations and corresponding output states to analyze the quantum circuit's error rates using a machine learning model. This model, composed of multiple dense layers, aims to minimize mean squared error loss. The model is trained over 200 epochs to predict error rates based on the input parameters ($\theta$, $\phi$, $\zeta$). Training progress is monitored through plots that demonstrate the model's learning curve. To validate the model's predictive capabilities, actual error rates are compared against model predictions, showing a high degree of accuracy.
